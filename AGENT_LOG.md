# AGENT_LOG.md

## Overview
This document outlines the specific use cases and implementation details where AI assistance was utilized throughout the development of the Careers Page Builder.

## AI Usage Details

### 1. Code Documentation & Comments
Throughout the project, an AI agent was used to generate professional-grade code comments and maintain comprehensive technical documentation (such as `Tech Spec.md` and `README.md`). This ensured that the codebase remains maintainable and that complex logic—especially around multi-tenancy and Supabase SSR—is well-explained for future developers.

### 2. UI Styling & Refinement
AI assistance was leveraged for specific styling refinements using Tailwind CSS. This included:
- Optimizing hover states for interactive components.
- Designing responsive layouts for the dashboard cards.
- Implementing micro-animations for a more premium user experience.

### 3. Component Optimization
The AI agent assisted in the structural refactoring of complex components. By extracting sub-components and memoizing expensive calculations, the agent helped improve overall code quality and frontend performance while maintaining the project's aesthetic goals.

## Learnings & Refinements
The integration of AI tools served primarily to streamline the "Developer Experience" (DX). By offloading the generation of boilerplate documentation and CSS utility application, more focus was placed on core architectural decisions and data integrity.
